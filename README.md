pyflix is not intended to be released because I don't have a focus on security in this addon yet
as I'm using it as a tool in furthering my education. be safe if you find it and use it as I
can't guarantee anything.

source links for scraper will change when happy with real_debrid.py changes

everything works but real debrid API is shit and I'm a noob so I need to fix how I select series
stuff but movies work fine. atm im force re adding individual episodes, i know this is bad because
i never get them instantly like movies. i may want to select all for download and only return the 
matching episode but im lost at this point.

drag n drop works on desktop but not mobile. brain doesnt like javascript.
